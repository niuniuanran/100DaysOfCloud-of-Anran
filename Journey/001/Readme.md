# Day 1

Ready for my #100DaysOfCloud challenge!

## Cloud Research: Elastic Beanstalk

- Elastic Beanstalk is powered by CloudWatch.
- In-place Deployment options on EB:
    1. All-at-once: downtime
    2. Rolling
    3. Rolling with additional batch
    4. Immutable
- In-place means everything happens within one EB environment. By contrast, Blue-Green deployment launches two environments, and uses Route53 to conduct the switching.
