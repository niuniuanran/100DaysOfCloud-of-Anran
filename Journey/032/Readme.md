# Azure resource group
- Same lifecycle
- Each resource can exist in only one resource group.
- You can move a resource from one resource group to another group.
- The resources in a resource group can be located in different regions than the resource group.
- When creating a resource group, you need to provide a location for that resource group. 
  - The resource group stores metadata about the resources. 
  - When you specify a location for the resource group, you're specifying where that metadata is stored. 
  - For compliance reasons, you may need to ensure that your data is stored in a particular region.
  - If the resource group's region is temporarily unavailable, you can't **update resources in the resource group** because the metadata is unavailable.
  - The resources in other regions will **still function** as expected, but you can't update them. 
- can be used to scope access control for administrative actions. To manage a resource group, you can assign Azure Policies, Azure roles, or resource locks.
- You can apply tags to a resource group. The resources in the resource group **don't inherit** those tags.
- A resource can connect to resources in other resource groups. This scenario is common when the two resources are related but don't share the same lifecycle. 
- When you delete a resource group, all resources in the resource group are also deleted.
- You can deploy up to 800 instances of a resource type in each resource group. 
- Some resources can exist outside of a resource group. These resources are deployed to the subscription, management group, or tenant. Only specific resource types are supported at these scopes.
- To create a resource group, you can use the portal, PowerShell, Azure CLI, or an ARM template.
