# Professional Question Prep - Day 1

## CloudHSM
- To interact with the HSMs in a cluster, you need the AWS CloudHSM client software. 
- When you create an AWS CloudHSM cluster with more than one HSM, you automatically get load balancing. 
- When you create the HSMs in different AWS Availability Zones, you automatically get high availability. 
- Typically you install the client on Amazon EC2 instances, known as client instances, that reside in the same VPC as the HSM ENIs, as shown in the following figure. That's not technically required though; you can install the client on any compatible computer, as long as it can connect to the HSM ENIs. 

## Amazon AppStream 2.0
- Improve user experience with desktop applications
- Fully managed non-persistent application and desktop streaming service

## DX
- Each connection consists of a single dedicated connection between ports on your router and an Amazon router. 
- We recommend establishing a **second connection** if redundancy is required. 
- For AWS Direct Connect, you can either have two direct connections, or use VPN as a backup.
