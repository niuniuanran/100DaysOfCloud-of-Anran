- You can use Power BI to analyze and visualize data stored in Azure Data Lake and Azure SQL Data Warehouse.
- A Local Network Gateway is an object in Azure that represents your on-premise VPN device.
- With the Azure Cloud Shell, you can run PowerShell cmdlets and scripts in a Web browser.
- You can restrict traffic to multiple virtual networks with a single Azure firewall.

  - The virtual network gateway needs to be located in a dedicated subnet in the Azure virtual network. This dedicated subnet is known as a gateway subnet and **must** be named `GatewaySubnet'.
- Big data services
  - **Azure SQL Synapse Analytics** (previously called Data Warehouse) is a cloud-based Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering from Microsoft. It is a large-scale, distributed, MPP (massively parallel processing) relational database technology in the same class of competitors as Amazon Redshift or Snowflake.
  - You can process big data jobs in seconds with **Azure Data Lake Analytics**. You can process petabytes of data for diverse workload categories such as querying, ETL,analytics, machine learning, machine translation, image processing and sentiment analysis by leveraging existing libraries written in .NET languages, R or Python.
  - **Apache Hadoop** was the original open-source framework for distributed processing and analysis of big data sets on _clusters_. **Azure HDInsight** is a fully managed, full-spectrum, open-source analytics service in the cloud for enterprises.
